# Quantower MT5 Auto-Stop Loss Fix

## üî¥ Critical Issue: MT5 Hedge Positions Closing Automatically

### Problem Description

When Quantower positions were opened, the corresponding MT5 hedge positions were being closed automatically **before** the Quantower positions were closed. This broke the 1:1 correlation between QT and MT5 positions.

**Observed Behavior:**
- User opens 2 QT positions ‚Üí 2 MT5 hedges open ‚úì
- User closes 2 QT positions ‚Üí MT5 hedges **already closed automatically** ‚úó
- QT sends close requests ‚Üí MT5 responds with "already_closed" ‚úó

### Root Cause Analysis

From the logs (`BridgeApp/logs/unified-20251001.jsonl` and `logs.txt`):

```
[17:05:50] MT5 close notification: tradeResult='MT5_position_closed'  ‚Üê UNSOLICITED
[17:05:50] MT5 close notification: tradeResult='MT5_position_closed'  ‚Üê UNSOLICITED
...
[17:06:59] QT position closed ‚Üí notifying bridge
[17:06:59] MT5 close notification: tradeResult='already_closed'  ‚Üê TOO LATE!
```

**The MT5 EA was automatically setting stop losses on hedge positions when they were opened:**

<augment_code_snippet path="MT5/ACHedgeMaster_gRPC.mq5" mode="EXCERPT">
````mql5
// Lines 4448-4450 (BEFORE FIX)
double slPrice = (request.type == ORDER_TYPE_BUY)
                 ? request.price - slDist
                 : request.price + slDist;
````
</augment_code_snippet>

These stop losses were being hit by market movement, causing MT5 positions to close independently of Quantower positions.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

**File:** `MT5/ACHedgeMaster_gRPC.mq5`

**1. Disabled Stop Loss Distance Calculation (Lines 4337-4346):**

<augment_code_snippet path="MT5/ACHedgeMaster_gRPC.mq5" mode="EXCERPT">
````mql5
/*----------------------------------------------------------------
 2.  Stop-loss distance (ATR-based)
     CRITICAL FIX: Disable automatic stop loss for hedge positions
     to maintain 1:1 correlation with Quantower positions.
     Hedge positions should only close when QT positions close.
----------------------------------------------------------------*/
// DISABLED: double slDist = GetStopLossDistance();
// Set slDist to 0 to disable automatic stop loss
double slDist = 0.0;
double slPoints = 0.0;
````
</augment_code_snippet>

**2. Set SL and TP to 0 (Lines 4445-4456):**

<augment_code_snippet path="MT5/ACHedgeMaster_gRPC.mq5" mode="EXCERPT">
````mql5
/*----------------------------------------------------------------
 5.  SL / TP
     CRITICAL FIX: Set SL and TP to 0 to disable automatic stop loss
     and take profit for hedge positions. Hedge positions should only
     close when Quantower positions close (1:1 correlation).
----------------------------------------------------------------*/
// DISABLED: Automatic stop loss and take profit
double slPrice = 0.0;  // No automatic stop loss
double tpPrice = 0.0;  // No automatic take profit

// Note: UseACRiskManagement TP logic is disabled for hedge positions
// to maintain 1:1 correlation with Quantower positions
````
</augment_code_snippet>

### Why This Works

By setting `slPrice = 0.0` and `tpPrice = 0.0`, the MT5 EA opens hedge positions **without any automatic stop loss or take profit**. This ensures:

1. **MT5 hedge positions only close when explicitly commanded** by the bridge (when QT positions close)
2. **1:1 correlation is maintained** - each QT position has exactly one corresponding MT5 hedge
3. **No premature closures** due to stop losses being hit

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Opening Positions
- User opens 1 QT position ‚Üí 1 MT5 hedge opens (no SL/TP set) ‚úÖ
- User opens 2 QT positions ‚Üí 2 MT5 hedges open (no SL/TP set) ‚úÖ
- User opens 3 QT positions ‚Üí 3 MT5 hedges open (no SL/TP set) ‚úÖ

### Closing Positions
- User closes 1 QT position ‚Üí 1 corresponding MT5 hedge closes ‚úÖ
- User closes 2 QT positions ‚Üí 2 corresponding MT5 hedges close ‚úÖ
- User closes all QT positions ‚Üí All MT5 hedges close ‚úÖ

### Market Movement
- Market moves against position ‚Üí MT5 hedge **stays open** (no SL to hit) ‚úÖ
- Market moves in favor of position ‚Üí MT5 hedge **stays open** (no TP to hit) ‚úÖ
- Only closes when QT position closes ‚úÖ

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Compile the MT5 EA:**
   - Open `MT5/ACHedgeMaster_gRPC.mq5` in MetaEditor
   - Press `F7` to compile
   - Verify no compilation errors

2. **Deploy to MT5:**
   - Copy the compiled `.ex5` file to your MT5 terminal's `Experts` folder
   - Restart MT5 or refresh the Navigator

3. **Test Scenarios:**

   **Scenario 1: Single Position**
   - Open 1 QT position
   - Verify 1 MT5 hedge opens with SL=0, TP=0
   - Close the QT position
   - Verify the MT5 hedge closes

   **Scenario 2: Multiple Positions**
   - Open 2 QT positions
   - Verify 2 MT5 hedges open with SL=0, TP=0
   - Close both QT positions
   - Verify both MT5 hedges close

   **Scenario 3: Partial Close**
   - Open 3 QT positions
   - Verify 3 MT5 hedges open
   - Close 1 QT position
   - Verify only 1 MT5 hedge closes (2 remain open)

   **Scenario 4: Market Movement**
   - Open 1 QT position
   - Verify 1 MT5 hedge opens
   - Wait for market to move significantly
   - Verify MT5 hedge **stays open** (no auto-close)
   - Close QT position manually
   - Verify MT5 hedge closes

4. **Check Logs:**
   - Review `BridgeApp/logs/unified-*.jsonl` for:
     - No "MT5_position_closed" messages before QT close requests
     - No "already_closed" responses from MT5
     - Clean 1:1 correlation between QT closes and MT5 closes

## üìù Related Issues

- **Previous Fix:** Quantower 1:1 Hedge Opening Logic (`docs/QUANTOWER_1TO1_HEDGE_FIX.md`)
  - Fixed the opening logic to use composite baseIds
  - This fix addresses the closing logic

- **Trailing Stops:** Quantower Trailing Stop Modification (`docs/QUANTOWER_1TO1_HEDGE_FIX.md`)
  - Trailing stops modify Quantower stop loss orders
  - Trailing stops do NOT send updates to MT5 EA
  - Only elastic updates are sent to MT5 EA

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No Automatic Risk Management on MT5 Hedges:**
   - MT5 hedge positions no longer have automatic stop losses
   - Risk management is handled by Quantower
   - MT5 hedges are purely for hedging QT positions

2. **Elastic Hedging Still Works:**
   - Elastic hedging (partial closes based on profit) still functions
   - Elastic updates are sent from QT to MT5 EA
   - This fix only disables automatic SL/TP on initial hedge opening

3. **Manual MT5 Closes:**
   - If you manually close an MT5 hedge position, it will send a notification to QT
   - This is expected behavior for manual intervention
